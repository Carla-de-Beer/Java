Bank of England Says Survey Shows Slower Investment by Firms

LONDON â€” British firms expect to slow down the pace of their business investment over the next 12 months, the Bank of England said on Wednesday, citing a survey carried out by its regional agents.

"Overall, firms in the survey reported expectations of broadly stable or slightly lower investment spending in the year ahead, after quite a significant increase in investment over the past year," the Bank said.

The BoE has previously said it expects the uncertainty triggered by the Brexit vote in June to weigh on business investment, slowing overall British economic growth.

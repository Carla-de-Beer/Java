# Student List API

This is a simple Spring Boot project that makes use of locally stored mock data to provide the student information and allows for CRUD operations on this data.

Based on an Amigos Code tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke7Tr4RgRTs

The project makes use of Java 8, Maven, Lombok and Spock/Groovy for the unit testing.
